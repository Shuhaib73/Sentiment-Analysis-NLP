## 🔍 **How It Works**

### Input Options  
1. **Single Text Analysis**:  
   - A user can enter any text or sentence in the provided text box.  
   - Upon clicking the **"Analyze Sentiment"** button, the app processes the input and provides real-time sentiment classification (Positive, Negative, or Neutral).  
   - The app also generates sentiment scores (e.g., positivity, negativity, neutrality) for a deeper understanding.  

2. **Dataset Analysis**:  
   - Users can upload a **CSV file** containing a column of text entries (e.g., tweets, reviews, comments).  
   - The app processes each row of text, classifying it into one of the three sentiment categories.  
   - Results are displayed in a new table with added columns for **cleaned text** and **predicted sentiment**.

---

### Output Features  

1. **Sentiment Classification**:  
   - Each text or row is labeled as **Positive**, **Negative**, or **Neutral**, making it easier to understand the overall sentiment.  

2. **Sentiment Scores**:  
   - For single text analysis, the app provides detailed numerical scores, including the degree of positivity, negativity, neutrality, and a compound score for sentiment intensity.  

3. **Interactive Visualizations**:  
   - **Pie Chart**: Visualizes the percentage distribution of each sentiment category (Positive, Negative, Neutral) for the dataset.  
   - **Bar Chart**: Displays sentiment trends over time or based on categories, helping users identify patterns and insights.  

These outputs enable quick, clear, and actionable insights for both single text and dataset-level sentiment analysis. 🎯
