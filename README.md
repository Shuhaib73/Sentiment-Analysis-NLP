## **Sentiment Analysis on Reviews using NLP**

**Introduction:**
Movie reviews play a significant role in influencing viewers' choices, and sentiment analysis helps in understanding the overall mood or sentiment expressed in these reviews. This project focuses on classifying IMDb movie reviews as positive or negative based on their textual content. Leveraging ANN, RNN, GRU, CNN and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks, which excel in capturing sequential dependencies in data, we aim to effectively model the semantic meaning of the reviews and classify them accurately.

**Dataset Description:**
The dataset consists of textual reviews sourced from IMDb, accompanied by binary labels indicating whether the sentiment of the review is positive or negative. Each review serves as a data point, with its sentiment label determining the target variable for classification.

**Feature Engineering:**
To featurize the textual reviews into numerical vectors, various NLP techniques employed. In this project, we'll explore methods such as word embeddings and tokenization to convert words into dense vectors. This enables the LSTM model to process the sequential data effectively, capturing the semantic meaning of the reviews.
